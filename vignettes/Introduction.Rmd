We are often faced with challenging questions such as "what is the optimum mix
of spatially-disaggregated interventions?". Answering questions of this kind
is usually made more difficult by the fact that, in most cases, there are budget limitations
in place which mean we can't afford all possible combinations of intervention
packages. om is here to help with this kind of budget-constrained optimisation
challenge for malaria modelling.

First, let's create a simple scenario to test out om. In our country, Omland,
there are 10 sub-national units where different malaria intervention packages
can be stratified. For each sub-national unit there are 5 different intervention 
packages that could be implemented. For each sub-national unit and intervention 
package we can estimate the impact and cost using a malaria simulation model.
Unfortunately, Omland has a finite health budget and can only assign $100 to 
malaria interventions.

How should Omland spend the $100 to maximise the impact of their malaria control
campaign?

Let's start with some malaria model outputs for Omland. This is a data.frame showing
the modelled cost and impact of each intervention package option, for each sub-national
unit.

```{r}
omland_output <- data.frame(
  unit = rep(1:10, each = 5),
  option = rep(1:5, 10),
  impact = rep(0:4, 10),
  cost = rep(c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20), 10)  * rep(c(rep(1, 5), rep(5, 5)), each = 5)
)
head(omland_output)
```

We also can specify the budget

```{r}
budget <- 100
```

To optimise Omland's budget spend in R, we need to provide some inputs as matrices,
lets convert our `data.frame` now

```{r}
# Each row is a spatial unit, each column and intervention package
impact_matrix <- matrix(omland_output$impact, nrow = 10, ncol =  5, byrow = TRUE)
impact_matrix
cost_matrix <- matrix(omland_output$cost, nrow = 10, ncol =  5, byrow = TRUE)
# We can see that intervention packages in some spatial units are more expensive than others
cost_matrix
```

With these inputs, we can now use om to optimise

```{r}
optimised <- om(z = impact_matrix, cost = cost_matrix, budget = budget)
optimised
```

Let's breakdown Omland's optimal solution. In the output, `i` represents the spatial 
unit and `j` the intervention package, so for each spatial unit, we have chosen
one package. We can also see the `cost` and `impact` of each package chosen. 
In spatial units 1 to 5, we've chosen the most expensive package, and in
spatial units 6 to 10 Omland doesn't spend anything. This makes sense -
the interventions in spatial unit 1-5 are a lot better value ($s per impact) than in 
spatial units 5-10!

We can also see that the total cost does not exceed Omland's budget of $100 - phew!
```{r}
sum(optimised$cost)
```

We can check to see what happens if Omland's malaria budget increases:
```{r}
new_budget <- 10000
optimised <- om(z = impact_matrix, cost = cost_matrix, budget = new_budget)
optimised
```

Great - now Omland can afford the most expensive, and most impactful, intervention
package in all sub-national units!

If some sub-national units do not have all intervention package options available 
we can just replace them with `NA` in the impact and cost matrices
```{r}
impact_matrix[1, 5] <- NA
cost_matrix[1, 5] <- NA
optimised <- om(z = impact_matrix, cost = cost_matrix, budget = new_budget)
optimised
```
