om can be used to find solutions to budget-optimisation challenges. This might be
finding the optimal mix of spatially-targeted intervention packages across a country 
that are affordable within a specified budget envelope. om can also deal with
optimisations where multiple budgets may be available to different subsets of
spatial units. For example, we may want to maximise the impact of a
global-donor budget to be optimised across multiple countries, combined with
contributions from the domestic budgets of each country.

All of the clever-stuff in the background is handled by the superb ompr package.
Please give appropriate attribution and cite the ompr package when using om 
(`citation("ompr")`) and be sure to check it out [here](https://dirkschumacher.github.io/ompr/)!

To get started, take a look at the [introductory vignette](https://mrc-ide.github.io/om/articles/Introduction.html)

Updates, reviews and improvements are encouraged via [PRs](https://github.com/mrc-ide/om/pulls)!

Any issues or clarifications? Please post on the [issues page here](https://github.com/mrc-ide/om/issues).
