\title{Cost-effectiveness frontier}
\usage{
frontier(x, threshold = Inf)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Data frame containing `cost` and `impact` columns.}

\item{threshold}{Optional numeric value describing the allowed cost per
unit of impact gained. After identifying the frontier, solutions with
ICERs above this value are discarded. We assume we start with the
cheapest dominant solution and iterate checking ICERs moving up in
solution cost from there.}
}
\value{
A data.frame with dominant, ICER compliant solutions
}
\description{
Identify the set of non-dominated solutions based on cost and impact.
}
\details{
Solutions are filtered so that no remaining option has higher cost and
lower or equal impact than another. After finding these dominant
solutions an optional `threshold` removes with ICER above a given threshold.
