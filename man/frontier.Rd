\title{Build Cost-Effectiveness Frontier}
\usage{
frontier(
  x,
  threshold = Inf,
  start_index = 1,
  up_filter = NULL,
  down_filter = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.frame containing cost and impact data for interventions}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Willingness-to-pay threshold for ICER acceptability.
Solutions with ICERs above this threshold will be rejected. Default is Inf.}

\item{start_index}{Integer. Row index of the starting solution in the x.
The algorithm builds the frontier from this point. Default is 1.}

\item{up_filter}{Function. Optional user-defined filter function for cost-increasing
solutions. Should take arguments (candidates, current) and return filtered candidates.}

\item{down_filter}{Function. Optional user-defined filter function for cost-saving
solutions. Should take arguments (candidates, current) and return filtered candidates.}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing the frontier solutions with an additional 'step'
  column indicating the sequence (negative values for cost-saving steps, positive
  for cost-increasing steps, 0 for the starting solution).
}
\description{
Constructs a cost-effectiveness frontier from a set of interventions by finding
the optimal sequence of solutions moving both up (more costly) and down (less costly)
from a specified starting point. The algorithm uses incremental cost-effectiveness
ratios (ICERs) and willingness-to-pay thresholds to determine acceptability.
