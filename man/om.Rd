\usage{
om(z, cost, budget, recipients = NULL, sense = "max")
}
\arguments{
\item{z}{Matrix of impact. Rows[i] = units, cols[j] = options, fill = impact measure.
If all units do not have all options, fill z with NA.}

\item{cost}{Matrix of cost. Rows[i] = units, cols[j] = options, fill = cost.
If all units do not have all options, fill cost with NA.}

\item{budget}{vector of budgets}

\item{recipients}{Matrix of recipients. Rows[i] = units, cols[j] = budget levels,
fill = binary indicator to show if Unit[i] has access to budget[j].}

\item{sense}{Optimisation target, can be "min" or "max"}
