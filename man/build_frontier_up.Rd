\title{Build Cost-Increasing Portion of Frontier}
\usage{
build_frontier_up(x, start_pos, threshold, up_filter)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A data.frame containing ordered cost and impact data}

\item{start_pos}{Integer. Position of the starting solution in the ordered data}

\item{threshold}{Numeric. Willingness-to-pay threshold for ICER acceptability}

\item{up_filter}{Function. Optional user-defined filter for cost-increasing candidates}
}
\value{
A data.frame containing cost-increasing frontier solutions with step numbers
  (positive values indicating cost-increasing steps)
}
\description{
Constructs the cost-increasing (upward) portion of the cost-effectiveness frontier
by iteratively selecting solutions with the lowest ICERs among options that cost
more and provide better impact than the current solution.
}
