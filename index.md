# om ![](reference/figures/Om.png)

om can be used to find solutions to budget-optimisation challenges. This
might be finding the optimal mix of spatially-targeted intervention
packages across a country that are affordable within a specified budget
envelope. om can also deal with optimisations where multiple budgets may
be available to different subsets of spatial units. For example, we may
want to maximise the impact of a global-donor budget to be optimised
across multiple countries, combined with contributions from the domestic
budgets of each country.

All of the clever-stuff in the background is handled by the superb ompr
package. Please give appropriate attribution and cite the ompr package
when using om (`citation("ompr")`) and be sure to check it out
